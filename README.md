# PCC - Physical Conditioning Centre

The idea is to record absenteeism in the work related with musculoskeletal problems.

### Brief
There is a company that now is running a program to control the absenteeism at work. This program taking focus on musculoskeletal problems during work phase. The physiotherapist is collecting the data with excel and each 3-4 months is asking for make some analysis with data in order to check if the program is helping to decrease the absenteeism.

### Plans
We want to create a web app where the physiotherapist can enter the data like now is  with excel. Then the idea is to generate the analysis and design some reports that will be presented in future meetings.
For the analysis we want to use Keen.IO services and try it.

We have just some months of experience working with django, so we decided to take this idea and develop it as a learning experience. 

Feel free to suggest us new ideas.
